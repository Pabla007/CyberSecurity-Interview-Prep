>[!question] 01 Tell me About yourself ??

Certainly, I'd be happy to tell you about myself..........
I am Simranjit Singh Pabla, who's deeply passionate about cybersecurity.
My journey into this field began during my undergraduate studies in when I was Preparing for Gate at PU. It was during this time that I realized the critical importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape.

I decided to further hone my skills by enrolling in TCM Security as well as Udacity's Intro to Cybersecurity Nanodegree program, which provided me with a solid foundation in network security, vulnerability analysis, and security protocols. During this Journey, I had the opportunity to work on various projects, such as conducting penetration tests, enhancing incident response plans, and managing compliance and risk.

In addition to my technical skills, I am highly motivated and detail-oriented. I believe in staying updated with the latest cybersecurity threats and technologies, as this field is dynamic and ever-evolving. I am also a proactive problem solver who enjoys the challenge of identifying and mitigating security risks.

Outside of my academic and professional life, I've been an active member in TCM discord , which has allowed me to network with other professionals in the cybersecurity field.


>[!question] 02 What is your greatest Strength ?__?

One of my greatest strengths is my ability to adapt and learn quickly. 
In the field of cybersecurity, where threats and technologies are constantly evolving, adaptability is crucial.

I've found that my capacity to embrace new tools, techniques, and approaches has been a significant asset in my previous roles. 
For example, during my Udacity's Nanodegree Journey  , I was frequently presented with new challenges and unfamiliar systems to assess. Through continuous learning and research, I was able to rapidly gain the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in these situations.

This adaptability not only allows me to perform effectively in diverse and dynamic environments but also to contribute innovative solutions to complex problems. I believe it's an essential quality in cybersecurity, where the landscape is characterized by constant change and the need to stay one step ahead of potential threats.


>[!question] 03 What is your greatest Weakness ?__?
Is it a Rhetorical question cuz Weakness is not to be discussed about but instead we should start working on it. 
Still there's One area I've identified for improvement is my "patience" with project timelines or while solving CTF's . I tend to be quite ambitious in setting deadlines for myself , which can occasionally lead to a sense of urgency and impatience.

While this can be a strength in terms of driving productivity, I've recognized that it's essential to balance it with an understanding of the time needed for thorough research, testing, and quality assurance in cybersecurity projects. Rushing can lead to oversight, which is unacceptable in this field.

To address this, I've started setting more realistic and flexible timelines while still maintaining a sense of urgency. 

I believe that acknowledging and actively working on one's weaknesses is a sign of personal and professional growth, and I'm committed to continuous improvement in this area to become a more effective and well-rounded professional.
