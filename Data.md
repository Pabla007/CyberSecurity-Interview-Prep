During my Btech program, my focus was consistently on adopting a research-oriented approach rather than hastily pursuing ideas that might initially appear attractive. I successfully published my research paper, which also served as my final year project. You can access the paper through the following links:

I strongly believe in the importance of honing one's proficiency in utilizing search engines, such as Google, as it significantly impacts one's career outcomes. My approach has always been to explore available resources independently before seeking answers through inquiries.

I had been searching for a way to break into the field of cybersecurity for a while, but I was struggling to find the right opportunity. Many people I spoke to could only offer theoretical advice, which wasn't very helpful for someone new like me. Then, one day, I stumbled upon a video from TCM Security, and it felt like the opportunity I had been waiting for.

However, something was still missing in my journey. It was at this point that I decided to take the Udacity test assessment, and I was fortunate enough to be selected for Udacity's Bertlemans Scholarship program. What's even more exciting is that I not only cleared the initial phase but also made it through phase 2, earning myself a Nanodegree.

This experience taught me that motivation alone isn't the key to success; it's about consistency and a genuine passion for learning. I've now reached a point where I feel confident enough to step through the door and earn certifications as I continue to grow and develop my skills. Currently, I'm gaining practical experience by working on Tryhackme boxes, and I have my sights set on passing the PNPT exams in the near future.
