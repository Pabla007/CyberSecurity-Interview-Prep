>[!question] How to piece all the attacks  together ?__?
Mentor's thoughts are that we should begin the day with `man in the middle 6` or `responder` as we want traffic to be generated we need those users coming in 

So 8:00 am is a good time when users are starting to come in or even after lunch
when they're starting to log back in.

If our scans are taking too long if you have a big network which it can happen so we have to look for websites that are in scope.

For that will use a module called http_version which we can search in Metasploit
and will see if anything responds to http version when i send out an Http request from my computer.

And it's less likely to get picked up Cuz we are making traffic on 80 and 443 which is very common.
