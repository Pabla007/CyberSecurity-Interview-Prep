<h2> PsExec is one of the more noisy when it comes to antivirus.</h2>
how to pronounce it PS--egg-zax
>[!important] Pro Tip:
Make Sure you get in quietly first go in navigate around try to find the antivirus being used 
And then try to use something as psexec or even another method in Metasploit to get around.

Try this first:
SMBexec
WMIexec 

and see if they work and we get a shell and if we can they are just Half shell (i.e. not fully interactive and not good enough)
to navigate around the C drive 

>[!question] What we can do ?_?
We can navigate around and see what kind of antivirus is running and then once we figure out and see that we can disable that
antivirus so that we can run something more robust like Windows meterpreter
