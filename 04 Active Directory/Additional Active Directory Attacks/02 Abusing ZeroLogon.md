Zero log is a very very dangerous attack to run in an environment and this is why the mentor has put it at the end of the course.

>[!question] What is a ZeroLogOn ?__?
Attacking the domain controller and setting the password to Null and taking over the domain controller.

Issue with that is when we run this attack we do not restore the password we will break the domain controller.
