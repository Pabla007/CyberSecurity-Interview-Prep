1st Tool : ProxyChains
cat /etc/proxychains4.conf

Another tools is S Shuttle 
The only difference is that we are not going to access the port like we use to do with proxychains.
And after the connection is established we don't need to provide sshuttle command each time we run anything.

Another tool to look is Chisel  https://github.com/jpillora/chisel


ssh -f -N -D 9050 i pivot root@10.10.155.5 
where 
-i for identity and that connection to root over
-f just backgrounds the ssh
-N means we don't want to execute remote commands and this is just ideal for port forwarding.
-D where we want to bind the port ?_?


We can use proxy chains to run classic Kerberoasting attack 
Access the machine via RDP

Basically any command that you want to run, you can run with proxy chains in front of it.
