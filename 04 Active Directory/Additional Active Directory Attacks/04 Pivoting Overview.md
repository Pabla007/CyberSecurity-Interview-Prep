What is Pivoting ?__?
If u have compromised two machines and that machine allows you access to two network interfaces and those network interfaces share a new network that was originally unavailable to you.


How to access this `arbitrary network` 
what we can do is we can actually setup up what is called a proxy and then pivot through that.

Tools to utilize to pivot through 

We are going to SSH into a machine that we can assume that we'have compromised.
As you can see that we are dual home here (i.e. we have 2 IP address here.)

If we ping 10.10.10.5 and got to know that we can't access that network. (i.e. I don't have route to that network)

So in order to access it we have to access this network through Pivoting.
