>[!question] What is Wdigest ?__? 
`Wdigest` is feature that is enabled by default on windows 7 and before.
What is does is it stores your password in clear text.

After windows 8 they have disabled it but the feature still exists.
We will turn on `wdigest` with Mimikatz and than we can go ahead and wait for somebody to log onto the computer so it does require somebody to log out and than log into the computer.
