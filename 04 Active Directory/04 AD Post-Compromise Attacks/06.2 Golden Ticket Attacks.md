>[!question] What is a Golden Ticket ?__?
A Golden Ticket attack exploits weaknesses in the Kerberos identity authentication protocol, which is used to access the AD, allowing an attacker to bypass normal authentication.


We need to copy the SID of domain and NTLM of the kebtgt 
We can put a fake user and id 500 stands for your RID which is the id used for the admin account

If Golden ticket gets picked up and want to get stealthier than look into the what a silver ticket is

>[!question] What is a Silver Ticket? 
>A Silver Ticket is a forged service authentication ticket. A hacker can create a Silver Ticket by cracking a computer account password and using that to create a `fake authentication ticket`

>[!note] Difference b/w Golden and Silver Ticket.......
A Golden Ticket attack gives attackers complete control over an organization's Active Directory (AD). Using a silver ticket, an attacker can create multiple ticket-granting service (TGS) tickets for a specific service without communicating with a domain controller (DC) in a network.
