Account tiering:
Your account administrators should be logging into the machines that they need to access which should only be domain controllers.

If for some reason that domain administrator logs into a user computer or a server and that user computer or that servers get compromised. 
We can impersonate that token if we compromised the domain controller.

Local Admin Restriction:
Local admin comes into play yet again if users are not local admins on their computers we cannot get a shell on that computer with their account that prevents us from getting onto the computer and utilizing this kind of attack.

For example user might have 2 accounts in account tiering:
Bob and Bob_A 
Bob will have his everyday regular user account and then when he wants to go access the Domain Controller he's gona log in as bob_a and he's only going to log in the Domain Controller and isloate his accounts with this tiering.

So something to think about in terms of defeating this and it's just beating a dead horse.
