Will set Burp Suite and Foxy-Proxy
- Intruder
- Pitchfork 
- Select the Payload 
- So this is the ART of crediential stuffing.

>[!question] : What is Password Spray ??

>[!important] : Important points
>- So Always Ask Before You Attack how many attempts we have before we will be getting locked out a bunch of user's and cause Denial of Service.
>- So whenever you see a login page always go for Default credentials because you never know..................
