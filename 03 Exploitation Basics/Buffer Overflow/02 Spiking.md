Disable Windows Real Time protection if that's enabled Cuz if we don't do it than it will block the Vulnserver will actually be blocked by windows defender.

Files -> Attach -> Vulnserver
It's Paused (i.e. bottom right side) and will hit start

>[!important]  Command to keep in Mind
>Srun
>Trun

<h2> Kali Linux :</h2>
Will connect to Vulnserver and by default Vulnserver run on Port 9999 and the IP address of Windows machine on which it is running.

Welcome to Vulnerable Server! Enter HELP for help.

Valid Commands:

STATS [stat_value]
RTIME [rtime_value]
LTIME [ltime_value]
SRUN [srun_value]
TRUN [trun_value]

Vulnserver takes these commands (i.e. mentioned above as input) and the primary command that will focus on is `Trun command`.So will do something called as Spiking to find the Trun command
**Tool that we will use to spike is Generic Send TCP**

┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali]
└─# generic_send_tcp 
argc=1
Usage: ./generic_send_tcp host port spike_script SKIPVAR SKIPSTR
./generic_send_tcp 192.168.1.100 701 something.spk 0 0

 ┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali]
└─# cat stats.spk        
s_readline(); will read the line 
s_string("STATS"); and will take a string and the string is STATS and will send variables at it
s_string_variable("0"); When will spike it will send the variables in all forms of iterations so might send thousand at a time and than 20 K and so on

┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali]
└─# cat trun.spk
s_readline();
s_string("TRUN ");
s_string_variable("0");

As we can see there is something vulnerable here but will see if we are able to control the EIP register or not
