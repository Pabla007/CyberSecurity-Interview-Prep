>[!important] : What is Required ?__?
>Windows 10 enterprise `VMware`
>Vulnserver
>Immunity Debugger


Will install Windows 10 enterprise in a VMware so search this on Google
Windows evaluation : https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/evalcenter

It will open the evaluation center and will scrol down to latest products 
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/

>[!question] : Victim Machine

On the Victim Machine we have install 2 tools
- Vulnserver (on the victim machine we are going to run Vulnserver  which will allow us the write a custom exploit and will get a reverse shell)

Wasted a lot of time simply have to download the zip file and not to login and clone it.

>[!note] :Turn off the Windows Defender Cuz it can block the download.

- Immunity Debugger

Remember that we have to STOP the security (i.e. Windows Defender and than install the software cuz it was not letting me to open that )
When we are triggering different type of attacks than we can see how it's affecting the memory and the stack.
