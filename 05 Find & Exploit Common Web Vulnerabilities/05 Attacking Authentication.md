>[!question] What is Attacking Authentication ?__?
Authentication is the process by which a system confirms the identity of a user or application. It's essentially all about who you are. 


>[!note] Authentication is a critical component of application security, and often basic attacks are overlooked.

As many flaws are logic based which means we usually review the authentication flow and than come up with edge cases to break it.

Difference B/w `Authentication` and `Authorization`:
<h2> Authentication:</h2>
Authentication is who you are ?_?
It's your identity (i.e. showing ur passport or your ID when you check into a hotel)

<h2> Authorization:</h2>
Authorization on the other hand is what you're allowed to do.
SO once you have checked into the hotel you get a card key and can use it to access your room and the pool 

2 Main Ways we're going to approach attacking Authentication:
1st will look into Brute force attacks something that lot's of development teams underestimate.
2ndly will look at the logic issues as they can turn out to be critical and probably 99% of the time undetectable by scanners and automated tools.

<h2> Brute Force</h2>
might seem like an easy concept, but a lot of people get frustrated Cuz they're not taking the right approach and thinking methodically.

Tools we can use to pull of these attacks:
BurpSuite
FFUF
Hydra 

Keep in Mind when attacking live systems, it might be slow and wordlist should not be too huge. 
We might also be blocked or lock accounts or cause instability in our target.
