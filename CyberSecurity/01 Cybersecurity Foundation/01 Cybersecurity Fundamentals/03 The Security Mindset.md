>[!question] What is The Security Mindset ?__?
- 1st I will use Twitter to be updated regarding the attacks and latest vulnerabilities out there.
- 2nd Will focus more on **protecting** rather than **attacking** 
   (i.e. make frameworks to scan the networks `(i.e. Purple team))`
- 3rd Always willing to give something to the community by writing blogs or video's `how to hate less and hack more `
