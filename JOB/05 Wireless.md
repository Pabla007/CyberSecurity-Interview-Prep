Choosing a vendor
Choosing the right vendor is key when developing your wireless solution. Be sure to consider current office architecture as well as plans for future growth, both in terms of employees and locations. You will want a vendor that has a history of releasing firmware updates. Technology changes rapidly, the devices connecting to your wireless network will be different a year from now, you want your solution to support them. You also want a vendor that supports hardware for years, a good wireless solution can last many years before it needs to be upgraded.

Features
Ideally, you want access points that have adjustable gain radios. This will allow you to turn down the power on your wireless near external walls or walls shared with other organizations, thereby shrinking your attack surface. If possible choose a solution that includes WIDS/WIPS or Wireless Intrusion Detection System/Wireless Intrusion Prevention System respectively. This will protect your wireless from rogue access points and other attacks.

Authentication
Choose the strongest authentication available, for instance, WPA2-Enterprise with 802.1x Encryption.
