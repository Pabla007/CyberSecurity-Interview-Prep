• NIST 800
• NIST 800-41R1
• NIST 800-123
• NIST 800-175BR1
• NIST 800-83R1

NIST 800-41R1
One of the standards for Firewall
Firewall Types and Technologies 
Access Control and Networking protocols
Planning your Firewall Implementation



NIST 800-123 is for Server Security Standard
General Server Security Standard
Server Vulnerablilties and Threats
Data types | Applications | Network Requirements
Security Controls
Logging and Monitoring


NIST 800-175Br1 is for Encryption
If your Organization is considering implementing encryption this standard will provide valuable insight as 
it provides important terminology as well as offers technical specification from the IEEE and IETF
Cryptography and Hashing Functions
Key generation and management


Which framework you should use NIST 800 framework or the CyberSecurity Framework ?_?
U should use both as NIST 800 standards are more practical and offer specific recommendations to secure your organization while the CSF is a bit more theoretical and is aimed at the leadership level.


NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Created in 2014 and revised in 2018 
Authentication and Identity Management Strategies
Risk Assessments
Supply Chain Security
VUlnerability Disclosures and More

>[!important] First you determine what your Security profile is ?_?
That means, is your company at the forefront of being proactive about security
or
Do you typically wait and react when an event occurs


Ideally, you want to be more proactive and less reactive.
It's best to consult an outside vendor to conduct a Risk Assessment than a self-assessment
