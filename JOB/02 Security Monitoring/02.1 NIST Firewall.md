Using NIST 800-41r1 LIST 5 key considerations when configuring a firewall for an organization.
Here are some that I came up with:

- Stateful vs. Stateless: A stateful firewall provides additional protections as opposed to a stateless firewall.

- If possible, purchase a firewall that contains deep packet inspection. This will allow the traffic to be analyzed deeper than simply port.

- If also using FW as a VPN, a firewall with NAC, network access control can inspect incoming traffic for things such as updated antivirus, time since the last scan, and other configurations.

- UTM, unified threat management, the firewall can dynamically detect suspicious probes and malware.

- Proxy for internet browsing.

- Additional security by implementing NAT, network address translation. The outside world does not communicate with internal IP addresses


What is a Firewall ?_?
- Firewalls are devices or programs that control the flow of network traffic between networks or hosts that employ differing security postures.

But..............................
Threats have moved gradually from lower layers of network traffic to the application layer as a result it has reduced the general effectivesness of firewalls in stopping threats carried through network communications.



To imrove Security and Effectiveness Organization sould implement following recommendations:
-Create a firewall policy that specifies how firewalls should handle inbound and outbound network traffic.

-Identify all requirements that should be considered when determining which firewall to implement

-Create rulesets that implement the organizationâ€™s firewall policy while supporting firewall performance.

-Manage firewall architectures, policies, software, and other components throughout the life of the firewall solutions.


Function:
Basic Firewalls operate on one or few layers - typically the lower layers while more advanced firewalls examine all the layers.
Myth: Network Address translation (NAT) is sometimes thought of as a firewall technology but it is actually a routing technology



Packet Filerting
Function: Most basic feature of a firewall is Packer Filter at the Network Layer. As we know that older firewalls were used to only packet filters that provided access control functionalitty for host address and communication sessions which is also know as Stateless inspection firewalls.

Filtering is of two types : 
Filtering inbound traffic is known as ingress filtering while 
Filtering outbound traffic is known as egress filtering 

Fragmented packets being blocked by firewalls is a common casuse of VPN interoperability issues.

Choosing whether to block, reassemble, or pass fragmented packets is a tradeoff between overall network interoperability and full system security.



Stateful Inspection 
Stateful inspection improves on the functions of packet filters by tracking the state of connections and blocking packets that deviate from the expected state This is accomplished by incorporating greater awareness of the transport layer.



Application Firewalls
A newer trend in stateful inspection is the addition of a stateful protocol analysis capability, referred to by some vendors as deep packet inspection

Application-Proxy Gateways
An application-proxy gateway is a feature of advanced firewalls that combines lower-layer access control with upper-layer functionality.

Never allows a direct connection

Like application firewalls, the proxy gateway operates at the application layer and can inspect the actual content of the traffic



Dedicated Proxy Servers
Dedicated proxy servers differ from application-proxy gateways in that while dedicated proxy servers retain proxy control of traffic, they usually have much more limited firewalling capabilities

Virtual Private Networking
A common requirement for these firewalls is to encrypt and decrypt specific network traffic flows between the protected network and external networks. This nearly always involves virtual private networks (VPN)

The two most common VPN architectures are gateway-to-gateway and host-to-gateway (i.e. provides a secure connection to the network for individual users, usually called remote users.)

Network Access Control
Another common requirement for firewalls at the edge of a network is to perform client checks for incoming connections from remote users and allow or disallow access based on those checks. This checking, commonly called network access control (NAC) or network access protection (NAP)


Unified Threat Management (UTM)
A typical unified threat management (UTM) system has a firewall, malware detection and eradication, sensing and blocking of suspicious network probes, and so on

Web Application Firewalls
exploits can be detected by specialized application firewalls called web application firewalls that reside in front of the web server.

Firewalls for Virtual Infrastructures
Using firewalls to monitor virtualized networking is a relatively new area of firewall technology, and it is likely to change significantly as virtualization usage continues to increase.
