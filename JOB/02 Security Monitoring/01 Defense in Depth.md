Defense in Depth Components:
Security Policies - Security Procedures 
Perimeter and network security - Intrusion Detection - Firewall
Monitoring - Alerts 
Host Security - Principle of Least Privilege


For example, firewalls act as the perimeter defense and Intrusion Detection Systems are the perfect fit for the next layer.

What are several things that come to mind that will need addressing ?
Network Firewall
If a web server is open to Internet traffic to it should be restricted to just internet related ports such as 80 in 443 and the Firewall.
- Excellent opportunity to use Host Based firewall

Least Privilege
Check the permission on all accounts, files, and directories required using the principle of least privilege

OS and Application Patching
Determine if the machine has the proper patches installed

Encryption
Are the files and disks encrypted on the server as well as database ?
