Principle of Least Privilege: is the idea that any user, program, or process should have only the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform its function.
Whereas does the Principle of Least Privilege fit in the 3 component model of security ?_?
- It fits in the Prevention 


>[!note] The principle of least privilege in theory is actually quite simple
Grant the lowest level of access that is required to accomplish the task

As you can see, the Principle of Least Privilege can apply to nearly anything. 
By focusing on physical controls, the organization hosting the intern has protected itself from risk by only allowing the intern to access the facility at specific times. 
Once there, the intern can only access the areas they need to be in to perform their duties.


Rather than every IT Admin having access to a specific server, the Privilege Access Management application has access, and when the IT Admin needs to log in and complete a task. They will check out a password, which can be the real password or it can be one-time use only password and login to do the work.

Not only does this decrease the attack surface by limiting the number of accounts that can access sensitive data, but it also creates another logging point. For instance, if data is destroyed or missing at a certain time, simply check the logs of the PAM to see who was the last to request the password near the time of the incident.

Account Tiring:
The second method of PoLP in IT Departments is more popular, primarily because there is no additional cost involved. Each IT Admin has two accounts, the first is a standard user account. This is what they login to their PC with to perform normal usage. When elevated privileges are needed they simply log in with their admin account, commonly known as a bank account. Example: User Account: bthompson Admin Account !bthompson
