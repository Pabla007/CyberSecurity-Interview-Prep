Prevention and Detection

What is a Hash ?
A file hash is a digital fingerprint that verifies a file, is what it says it is
and has not been changed.

it is important to note that a hash is not encryption and that there is no decrypting of a file hash. It is a one-way process.


Digital Signatures are used for authenticity

The person or site are who they say they a are they use hashing algorithms
At this point they are signed using the public key infrastructure we learned about it in a previous section.

The `hash` is combined with the sender's `private key` and is send to the recipient.
At this point, the signature is validated by using the public key.


Key Terms
File Hash: is the process of using an algorithm for verifying the integrity of a computer file.
Collision: is a situation that occurs when two distinct pieces of data have the same hash value.
