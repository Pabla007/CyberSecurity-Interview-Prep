With Asymmetric Encryption, keys are in pairs.
Public Key Infrastructure is the key management system.
PKI uses Digital Certificates to verify identity.

A public key infrastructure or PKI is a set of servers, software, and protocols that manage the keys of a group of users.
PKI uses digital certificates to verfy identity
Certification authorities are organizations that act to validate identities and bind them to cryptographic key pairs by issuing those digital certificates.

Some Types of Asymmetric Encryption:
RSA Rivest Shamir Adleman
Diffie-Hellman



>[!important] Asymmetric Strengths and Weaknesses :
Authentication, allows you to verify the identity of the sender/recipient.
Private Key never needs to be shared.
Slower than Symmetric.
By requiring a Certificate Authority it creates the need to trust a 3rd party.


>[!note] 
>The size of cipher text is the same or larger than the original plain text.

Public key can used to Encrypt the Data and only matching private key can be used to decrypt the data.
