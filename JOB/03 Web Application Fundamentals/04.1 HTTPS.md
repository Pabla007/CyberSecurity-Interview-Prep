HTTPS is the protocol that allows your browser to communicate with web servers.
In order to change the HTTP which used clear text HTTPS which used ciphertext
we add SSL/TLS where SSL is secure socket layer which around 2000 was effectively renamed TLS.

You are likely running either TLS version 1.2 or 1.3 depending on which browser

When your browser reaches out to an HTTPS site, it is using asymmetric cryptography. It checks to make sure that digital certificate, is to authentin and issued by a certificate authority.

At that point, the rest of the TLS handshake occurs now a symmetric session has begun allowing for the fast communications we expect from the internet.

With the TLS handshake we just mentioned is the method our traffic becomes fully excrypted when communicating with web servers.

The steps are the client, in this case our internet browser reaches out with a "Hello"
it includes the SSL, TLS version number the cipher suite which is what algorithms are being used and a random string.

The server responds with it's own "Hello" which includes roughly the same information but also includes the digital certificate. 

Your browser authenticates the certificate with a trusted CA and encrypts the traffic using the server's public key.

The client sends a random string as a pre-master secret using the public key that is decrypted by the server using the private key.

At this point both the client and server generates symmetric keys using the client random, server random and pre-master keys.

<h2>Secure Shell</h2>
The initial handshake is similar to TLS with a version exchange however in opposition to TLS where a digital certificate is exchanged at this point a password is sent from the client to the server.
```
sudo sshd -T | grep "cipher"
```

<h2>SFTP</h2>
SFTP authenticates the same as SSH but
FTPS uses the TLS encryption method we learned about in the HTTPS section.

<h2>RDP</h2>
Remote Desktop Protocol which is how we connect to our Windows machines.
The initial exchange is an x.224 PDU (i.e. protocol data unit)
which basically tells the server what security protocols the client supports.

Those protocols are typically RC4 for standard RDP or TLS for enhanced security.

The next two exchanges focus on details for channels used and encryption methods.

Now the client sends a randomized string encrypted with the server's public key.

It is at this point, subsequent traffic is encrypted.
