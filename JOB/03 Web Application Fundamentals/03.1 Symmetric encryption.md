>[!important] It only provides confidentiality.

Symmetric encryption uses only `one key`, in this case, a private or secret key to both encrypt and decrypt the data.

Two types of Symmetric encryption algorithms:
Block Algorithms.
Stream Algorithms.


Types of Symmetric Encryption:
AES Advanced Encryption Standard.
Twofish
RC4 Rivest Cipher 4.


Symmetric Strengths and Weaknesses:
- Very Fast.
- Each party already has the key so the data can be transmitted in any manner.
- Key transport is difficult. The only true secure way is to hand it from person to person.
- Once key is exchanged there is no identity verification as to who has the key.

The size of cipher text is the same or smaller than the original plain text.
