Many banking systems use symmetric encrypion due to its performance advantage.
Data at rest, files that are stored on a hard drive often use symmetric encryption because the system or the user hold the key.

Digital certificates to verify identity with a third party.Finally Asymmetric is perhaps most commonly associated with TLS in the form of HTTPS or secure web browsing. (i.e. the little lock in your address bar)

The Perfect Example is use both : In VPN the connection is established using asymmetric encryption then private keys are exchanged and symmetric encryption is established.

SSH operates in much the same way
