Where does encryption fit in our three component model of security ?_?

I have  frame all topics in the form of a 3-Component Model:
Prevention which is what most people think when it comes to Cybersecurity. Keep the bad guys out! and good stuff in.
Detection if an adversary does get past our defenses we want to know!
Response These are the actions or mitigation, we take based on the detection.
>[!important] It fits in prevention.
Sometimes encryption only needs to work for a short time, the data isn't relevant after the transaction has processed.
 


Key Terms
Encryption: is the process that converts plaintext, or text that can be read by anyone, into ciphertext and it can only be read by the person who has the secret code, or decryption key.
Plaintext: data that represent only characters of readable material.
Ciphertext: is encrypted text modified from plaintext using an encryption algorithm.
Algorithm: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
