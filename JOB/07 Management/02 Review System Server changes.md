Reviewing system and server changes is a critical component of both information security and cybersecurity practices. Here's how it impacts each field:

### Information Security:

1. **Data Integrity:** Ensures that data remains accurate, reliable, and unaltered during and after system/server changes.
    
2. **Compliance:** Helps in adhering to legal and regulatory requirements by ensuring changes donâ€™t compromise data privacy or security policies.
    
3. **Risk Management:** Identifies potential vulnerabilities introduced by changes and assesses their impact on overall security posture.
    
4. **Incident Prevention:** Proactive review prevents unintentional changes that might lead to security incidents or breaches.
    

### Cybersecurity:

1. **Threat Mitigation:** Regularly reviewing changes helps in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cyber threats.
    
2. **Patch Management:** Ensures that security patches and updates are implemented promptly to protect systems from known vulnerabilities.
    
3. **Configuration Management:** Verifies that configurations align with security best practices, reducing the attack surface and enhancing resilience against cyber attacks.
    
4. **Intrusion Detection:** Monitoring changes allows for swift detection of unauthorized or malicious alterations, indicating potential intrusion attempts.
    
5. **Incident Response:** Helps in tracing back the origin and impact of a security incident by understanding recent system changes.
    

In summary, systematic review of system and server changes is vital in both information security and cybersecurity contexts. It promotes data integrity, regulatory compliance, risk management, threat mitigation, and effective incident response, ensuring a robust and resilient security posture for organizations.
