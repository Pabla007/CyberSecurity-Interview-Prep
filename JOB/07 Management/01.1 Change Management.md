Change Management in cybersecurity refers to the structured approach of managing alterations, updates, or modifications to an organization's IT systems, applications, and processes. 

In the realm of cybersecurity, change management becomes pivotal to maintaining a secure environment while evolving with technology and business needs. 

It involves assessing the potential security risks associated with any change, implementing security measures, and ensuring that all alterations comply with security policies and standards. 

This process not only safeguards against security breaches caused by system vulnerabilities but also guarantees the `integrity` of critical data and the continuity of operations in the face of changes or updates.
