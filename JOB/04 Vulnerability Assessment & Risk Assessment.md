This slide probably looks pretty familiar, as it looks a lot like a risk Assessment slide.

In Risk assessment Slide we have the:
the risk statement, likelihood, impact , any mitigating controls and then
finally what our residual risk is

The only difference here is that we've added our risk treatment and the 
risk treatment demonstrates that we've thought about the risk, and it shows what decision we've made about how we're going to treat that risk.
