We can also gain root access through Metasploit
(i.e. Will Use `Ctrl + c` to stop the execution's 
So keep in mind not to use `Ctrl + Z` Cuz it will close the Metasploit Framework)

In Metasploit, LHOST, RHOST and SRVHOST are some of the most commonly used variable names. 
LHOST refers to the IP of your machine, which is usually used to create a reverse connection to your machine after the attack succeeds.
RHOST refers to the IP address of the target host. 
And SRVHOST is where the module will connect to download additional payload elements.
