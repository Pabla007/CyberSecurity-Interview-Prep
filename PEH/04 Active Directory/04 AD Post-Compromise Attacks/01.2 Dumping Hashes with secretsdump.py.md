>[!question] What is SecretsDump ?_?
From Impacket toolkit will use a Secretsdump to Dump SAM and LSA secrets.

So we have used a password to pass around the network: 
We discovered that .137 and .141 have the same local admin  (i.e. Frank Castle)
We could use Psexec with Metasploit and run Hash dump and see if we get luck. But that's a little bit on the Noisy Side. (i.e. get picked up by Windows Defender)

It's not only dumping hashes but also LSA (i.e. Local Security Authority) Secrets and DPAPI system.
