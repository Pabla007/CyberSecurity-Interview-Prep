It's reported that it's about a 15 percent or so decrease in speed on file transfers when you're running with SMB
So that SMB signing does cause a little bit longer time period but Longer time period for computer security is worth the trade off

Big think to talk about :
- SMB signing should be enabled
- Local admin should be restricted
and other are just best practice sort of things but still don't completely eliminate the attack.
