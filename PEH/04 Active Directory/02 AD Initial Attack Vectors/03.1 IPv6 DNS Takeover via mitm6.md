Have to Configure the  Ldaps 

(i.e. more technical explanation :This attack attempts a DNS takeover in a network via IPv6 using mitm6, which listens for ipv6 DNS requests, spoofs the DNS reply and passes it to ntlmrelayx.

Ntlmrelayx captures NTLM credentials obtained through a fake WPAD proxy and relays them to an authentication service. Once it succeeds in authentication, it dumps the domain information. 
This attack can be built upon to get all the NTLM hashes from the domain.

When we reboot a machine (i.e. that reboot just triggers an event) that event comes through to us and could potentially use that machine to log into DC and we don't have to be an admin or anything.

>[!warning] Warning: 
When we run MITM6 Mentor advise to run it in small sprints cuz if if run it for longer period of time it will cause Outages in a Network. (i.e. )
