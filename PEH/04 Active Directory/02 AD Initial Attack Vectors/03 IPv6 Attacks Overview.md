>[!question] What is IPv6 Attack ?__?
Here we are  going to be talking about DNS takeover attacks via IPV6 and this is the go to attack.

LDAP relaying 

Previously we have used:
Responder to grab the hashes try to crack them and then it was 
SMB relay (i.e. if we are not able to crack the hashes try to rely them)

**This is another form of relaying but much more reliable Cuz it uses IPV6 **

We typically run on IPV4 but chances are the network not even utilizing IPv6
So if we are utilizing IPV4 but IPV6 is turn on than who's doing DNS for IPV6 ?_?
And the answer usually is nobody's doing that

This is still very undetected (i.e. hard to detect) and still very very prominent in Network.
