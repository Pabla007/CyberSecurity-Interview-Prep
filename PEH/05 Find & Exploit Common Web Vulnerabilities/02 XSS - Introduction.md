>[!question] What is XSS aka JavaScript Injection ?__?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise begin and trusted websites

In a nutshell, it lets us execute JS in a victim's browser and often gives us control over the application for that user.

Three main types of cross site scripting: 
<h2> Reflected</h2>
Reflected cross site scripting is where the script you're trying to inject comes from the current HTTP request
You send a request
You get a response
That script is included in the response.

It's somewhat limiting as you can only target yourself unless the payload is via the URI

<h2> Stored aka comments</h2>
Stored cross site scripting is much more powerful and the payload is stored in a database and than retrieved later.

This allows you to attack other users and therefore the impact of  the vulnerability is much higher 

<h2> DOM-based aka Everything is happening locally</h2>
DOM-based scripting is that the Client Side has some vulnerable JS that users untrusted inputs instead of having a vulnerability Server Side.

This allows you to attack other users and therefore the impact of  the vulnerability is much higher 


Command : alert(1)
is the most famouse cross site scripting payload that you will come across.
Avoid using alter(1) cuz of the changes in Chrome and also how often it's filtered and detected.

>[!note] Mentor recommend when u're testing for XSS either use print or prompt

LogKey: 
function logKey(event){console.log(event.key)}
document.addEventListner('keydown', logKey)
