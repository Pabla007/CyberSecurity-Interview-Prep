<h2>How it works ?_?</h2>
- MAC address have identifier's assigned to NICs which is stored in ROM(i.e. And if we take the first 3 pair and put it into the lookup will will know what we are up against).
- Used at the `Datalink Layer`
mac address --> Layer 2 ---> related to switches.

Routers and Switched utilize layer 2 to forward the data to destination.

Mac Address lookup can be used to identify what we are up against.
