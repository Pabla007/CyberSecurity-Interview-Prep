>[!question] What is the process to hunt something down ?
>- Start with a google search. (i.e. Who is in this role at this company if looking at a specific person at a company)
>- Then will go to phonebook.cz or hunter.io to identify the formatting of the email (i.e. try not to burn the clear bits unless need to)
>- After reaching at this point we can verify this mail through Email Hippo (i.e. https://tools.emailhippo.com/)

Using email hippo we can simply validate the mail without interacting with the person of doing an investigation of a client so without interacting with him we can validate his/her mail.
