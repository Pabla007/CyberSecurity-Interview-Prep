Now will talk about web information gathering or might encounter a website for internal or external test.

>[!question] :Why r sub domain important ?
We might run something like dev.tesla.com  or testsite.tesla.com 

<h2> Tools</h2>
Asset Finder
Sublist3r
Amass


Another way through which we can find out the subdomain or certificates is https://crt.sh/

Sublist3r was a great tool of it's time but now this tool is popular and one of the go to tools

So i think sublist3r gives results more quickly than amass.

>[!note] :And will save the `sub domains` output to a txt file and will pass it to **httprobe** to check which links are alive and not are not.
